# H5BPCodeKit
H5BPCodeKit is a collection of frameworks and utilities that work in
unison to form a simple starting point for building web sites+apps
(without the command-line). You'll need CodeKit to get started with
pre-compiling. ~~Extras & Themes are included as well for Coda, and
other commonly used code editors.~~ (Coming Soon)

This repo will be kept in sync with each stable
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) release.
If you have ideas to enhance or make this better.. start cloning and
have at it.
